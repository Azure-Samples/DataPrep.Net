# Microsoft DataPrep .Net SDK

The Microsoft DataPrep SDK is used to load, transform, and write data for machine learning workflows. You can interact with the SDK in any dotnetcore environment.

## Features

This project provides the following features:

* Automatic delimited file type detection. The SDK can automatically detect whether your data is in any of the supported delimited file types. You donâ€™t need to use special file readers for formats, or to specify delimiter, header, or encoding parameters.


* Summary statistics can be generated quickly for a dataflow with a single line of code.

* Complicated data prepare task can be archived through a serial of data flow steps.
